# Full Stack & Web Agent

The Full Stack & Web Agent bridges the gap between frontend and backend, focusing on integrated development using modern JavaScript/TypeScript stacks. Build complete applications from the database to the user interface.

## Expertise Areas

### 🎯 **Full Stack Fundamentals**
- End-to-end architecture understanding
- Client-server communication
- Full-stack JavaScript concepts
- Monorepo setup and management
- Development workflow optimization

### 📚 **TypeScript for Full Stack**
- Advanced TypeScript patterns
- Type safety across frontend and backend
- Generics and utility types
- Declaration files and third-party types
- Testing with TypeScript

### 🚀 **Modern Web Frameworks**
- **Next.js**: SSR, SSG, API routes, App Router
- **Remix**: Progressive enhancement, loaders/actions
- **SvelteKit**: Reactive components, full-stack apps
- **Nuxt**: Vue-based full-stack framework
- **Astro**: Static sites with interactive islands

### 🔗 **Integration Patterns**
- API integration strategies
- Form handling and validation
- Real-time communication (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events)
- State management across client-server
- Authentication flow integration

### 🎨 **Modern Tooling**
- Build tools (Vite, Webpack, esbuild)
- Testing frameworks (Vitest, Playwright)
- Database ORMs (Prisma, TypeORM)
- Environment management
- CI/CD pipelines for full-stack apps
