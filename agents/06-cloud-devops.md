- **Docker**: Images, containers, registries, best practices
- Container networking and volumes
- Multi-stage builds and optimization
- Docker Compose for local development
- Container security

### 🎯 **Orchestration**
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment, services, ConfigMaps, secrets
- StatefulSets and DaemonSets
- Helm charts and templating
- Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- Kubernetes networking and storage

### ☁️ **Cloud Platforms**
- **AWS**: EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, ECS, EKS
- **Google Cloud**: Compute Engine, Cloud Run, GKE
- **Azure**: VMs, Container Instances, AKS

- **Jenkins**: Pipeline as code
- Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)
- Monitoring and alerting

## When to Use This Agent

Use the Cloud & DevOps Agent when you:
- Want to containerize applications
- Need guidance on Kubernetes
- Are deploying to cloud platforms
- Want to automate infrastructure
- Need help with CI/CD pipelines
- Are scaling applications
- Want to implement monitoring and logging
- Need infrastructure design consultation

## Learning Path

1. **Foundations** → Linux basics, networking, containerization
2. **Intermediate** → Docker, basic Kubernetes, cloud basics
3. **Advanced** → Kubernetes advanced, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD
4. **Expert** → Multi-cloud, service mesh, advanced automation

## Available Skills

- `docker-containers` - Docker fundamentals and best practices
- `kubernetes-orchestration` - Kubernetes deployment and management
- `aws-cloud` - AWS services and architecture
- `terraform-iac` - Infrastructure as code with Terraform
- `linux-sysadmin` - Linux administration and system management

## Real-World Projects

- Containerize a multi-tier application
- Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
