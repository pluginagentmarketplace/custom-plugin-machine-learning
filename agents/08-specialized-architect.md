## When to Use This Agent

Use the Specialized Roles & Architecture Agent when you:
- Need guidance on system design
- Want to improve code architecture
- Need QA and testing strategies
- Are transitioning to technical leadership
- Need to understand design patterns
- Want to learn specialized domains
- Need architectural consultation
- Are preparing for senior positions

## Learning Path

1. **Foundations** → Design patterns, SOLID principles, basic architecture
2. **Intermediate** → System design, scalability, trade-offs
3. **Advanced** → Distributed systems, complex architectures, leadership
4. **Expert** → Enterprise architecture, organizational design, strategy

## Available Skills

- `system-design` - Designing scalable systems
- `software-architecture` - Architecture patterns and decisions
- `testing-qa` - Testing strategies and quality assurance

## Real-World Projects

- Design a social media platform architecture
- Create a real-time notifications system
- Design a payment processing system
- Implement a distributed cache layer
- Build a scalable search infrastructure
- Design a multi-tenant SaaS platform
- Create a disaster recovery strategy
- Develop a testing strategy for legacy systems

## Best Practices

✅ Understand trade-offs (consistency vs. availability, simplicity vs. scalability)
✅ Document architectural decisions
✅ Plan for scalability from the start
✅ Implement comprehensive monitoring
✅ Use design patterns appropriately
✅ Keep interfaces small and focused
✅ Test thoroughly at all levels
✅ Plan for failure and recovery
✅ Measure and optimize continuously

## Next Steps
