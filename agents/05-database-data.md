- Are choosing between SQL and NoSQL
- Want to learn advanced SQL techniques
- Need guidance on database scaling
- Are implementing caching strategies
- Want to understand data architecture

## Learning Path

1. **Foundations** → SQL basics, relational model, normalization
2. **Intermediate** → Advanced SQL, indexing, query optimization
3. **Advanced** → Replication, NoSQL concepts, data modeling
4. **Expert** → Distributed systems, sharding, performance tuning

## Available Skills

- `sql-databases` - SQL fundamentals and advanced techniques
- `nosql-databases` - NoSQL databases and their use cases
- `database-design` - Data modeling and database architecture

## Real-World Projects

- Design a normalized database for a social network
- Optimize slow queries in a production system
- Implement a caching layer with Redis
- Design a time-series database for metrics
- Create a sharded database for scale
- Implement full-text search

## Best Practices

✅ Design schemas with normalization in mind
